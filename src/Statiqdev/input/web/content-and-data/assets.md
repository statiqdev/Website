Asset files are either copied directly to the output folder or, if the file type is known to require processing like Less or Sass files, transformed and then copied to output.

Currently the following types of asset files can be processed:
- Less
- Sass

Any other asset files are copied directly to the output folder. In the future, additional processing may become available like minification or image adjustments.
